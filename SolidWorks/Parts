# Robotic Gripper Project

### Overview
This repository is dedicated to documenting the development of a robotic gripper. Here, you will find design files, code, and other relevant resources related to this project. 

### Project Goals
* [List your specific project goals here, such as: design and build a gripper capable of picking up objects of various sizes and weights, integrate with a robotic arm, etc.]

### Project Structure
* **CAD Models:** 3D models of the gripper components created using [software name, e.g., SolidWorks, Fusion 360].
* **Code:** Source code for controlling the gripper, including firmware for microcontrollers and control algorithms.
* **Documentation:** Technical documentation, design specifications, and assembly instructions.
* **Testing:** Results and data from testing and validation.
