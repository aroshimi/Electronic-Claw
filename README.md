# Robotic Gripper - First Solo Project

**Author:** Lucas Miguel Velez Souza

**Course:** Mechanical Engineering

**Institution:** ederal University of Maranh√£o (UFMA) 

**Description:**

This repository contains the CAD files of my first solo project: a robotic gripper. The goal of this project was to apply the knowledge acquired in Mechanical Engineering in practice, developing a functional and efficient mechanism.

**Files:**

* **SolidWorks:** All parts and assembly files created in SolidWorks are available in this repository. Formats include:
    * Parts (.sldprt)
    * Assemblies (.sldasm)
    * Drawings (.slddrw)
* **AutoCAD:** Technical drawings of the robotic gripper are also available in DWG format for those who prefer to use AutoCAD.

**Functionality:**

* [Describe the functionalities of your robotic gripper here, e.g., load capacity, reach, type of movement, etc.]

**Technologies Used:**

* SolidWorks
* AutoCAD

**Notes:**

* This project was developed as part of my learning in Mechanical Engineering and may contain some limitations.
* Feel free to contribute to this project or send me suggestions.

**Images:**

[Add images of your robotic gripper from different angles to illustrate the project. You can use GitHub Markdown to embed the images directly into the README.]
