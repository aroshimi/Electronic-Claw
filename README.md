# Robotic Gripper - First Solo Project
**PROJECT IN PROGRESS, UNFINISHED!!!!!**

**Author:** Lucas Miguel Velez Souza

**Course:** Mechanical Engineering

**Institution:** Federal University of Maranh√£o (UFMA) 

**Description:**

This repository contains the CAD files of my first solo project: a robotic gripper. The goal of this project was to apply the knowledge acquired in Mechanical Engineering in practice, developing a functional and efficient mechanism.

**Files:**

* **SolidWorks:** All parts and assembly files created in SolidWorks are available in this repository. Formats include:
    * Parts (.sldprt)
    * Assemblies (.sldasm)
    * Drawings (.slddrw)
* **AutoCAD:** Technical drawings of the robotic gripper are also available in DWG format for those who prefer to use AutoCAD.

**Functionality:**

* Our robotic gripper is designed to be extremely versatile, adapting to a wide range of tasks. With its precision and strength, it can be used in various environments and applications, from industry to home use.

**Technologies Used:**

* SolidWorks
* AutoCAD

**Notes:**

* This project was developed as part of my learning in Mechanical Engineering and may contain some limitations.
* Feel free to contribute to this project or send me suggestions.
