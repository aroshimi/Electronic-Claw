# Robotic Gripper Project

### Overview
This repository houses the development of a robotic gripper. Here, you'll find design files, code, and other resources related to this project.

### Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to **enhance my proficiency in specific technologies or skills, e.g., robotics, programming, 3D modeling** by:

* Designing and building a functional robotic gripper.
* Implementing control algorithms for precise movements.
* Experimenting with different materials and mechanisms.

### Project Structure
* **CAD Models:** 3D models of the gripper components created using [software name, e.g., SolidWorks, Fusion 360].
* **Code:** Source code for controlling the gripper, including firmware for microcontrollers and control algorithms.
* **Documentation:** Technical documentation, design specifications, and assembly instructions.
* **Testing:** Results and data from testing and validation.
